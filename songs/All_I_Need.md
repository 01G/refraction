#All I Need#
##Shawn McDonald, 2004##

<span class="notes">E   EM7			A</span>
As I sit here and think about all that You've done
<span class="notes">		B			E</span>
About how You gave me Your one and only Son
<span class="notes">E		EM7			A</span>
And I'm trying to fathom all that You are,
<span class="notes">		B			E</span>
but live so far, Lord You're so beyond me

I fall down in reverence and I fall down in fear
And I'm asking You, Lord, won't You please draw near?
Won't You open my eyes, so that I can see
The way that You are working in me 

(Chorus) All I need is Your love
To come and fill this heart of mine
My heart is a desert that has gone dry
And I need Your love to carry me 
by, by, by, by, by, To carry me by, by, by, by, by, To carry me by

And I lay down my life and I put it before You
All that I am is in Your hands
And I'm not going to question, why You're so faithful
Why that You give me the blessing that You have 

Let the glory be known, let the glory be shown
To lift You up unto the throne
You are my God, You are my King
To You I give, I give You everything

(To Chorus x2)
