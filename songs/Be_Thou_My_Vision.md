Be Thou my vision O lord of my heart
<span class="notes">Em	A	Bm	A</span>
Nought be all else to me, save Thou art
<span class="notes">Bm	D	Bm	A</span>
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
<span class="notes">D	Bm	Em	D</span>
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for the fight,
be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight.
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower:
raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, after victory won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
