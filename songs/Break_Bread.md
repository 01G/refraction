Let us break bread together on our knees

When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun

Oh Lord, have mercy on me.

Let us drink wine together on our knees
Let us drink wine together on our knees
When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun
Oh Lord, have mercy on me.

Let us praise God together on our knees
Let us praise God together on out knees
When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun
Oh Lord, have mercy on me.
