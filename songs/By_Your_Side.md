#By Your Side#
##Tenth Avenue North, 2008##
<pre>
<span class="notes">G   Em   D   C</span>

<span class="notes">G</span>
Why are you striving these days?
<span class="notes">Em</span>
Why are you trying to earn grace?
<span class="notes">D				C</span>
Why are you crying?  Let me lift up your face
<span class="notes">G</span>
Just don’t turn away

Why are you looking for love?
Why are you still searching as if I’m not enough?
To where will you go child?
Tell me where will you run?
To where will you run?

<span class="notes">			Em		C</span>
(Chorus) Cause I’ll be by your side wherever you fall
<span class="notes">	G		D</span>
In the dead of night whenever you call
<span class="notes">	Em		C			G</span>
And please don’t fight these hands that are holding you
<span class="notes">	D		G</span>
Yeah My hands are holding you

Look at these hands, and My side
They swallowed the grave on that night
When I drank the world’s sin so I could carry you in
And give you life, I wanna give you life

<span class="notes">	D	Em</span>
Cause I, I love you
<span class="notes">	C	D</span>
I want you to know
<span class="notes">	D	Em</span>
That I, I love you
<span class="notes">	C	D</span>
I’ll never let you go

(To Chorus x2)
