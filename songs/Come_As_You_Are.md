<span class="notes">C                       F               C</span>
Come out of sadness from wherever you've been
<span class="notes">F             C         G       Gsus</span>
Come, broken hearted let rescue begin
<span class="notes">Am    G/B       C         F           C</span>
Come  find your mercy, oh sinner, come kneel
<span class="notes">F             C           G           Am</span>
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
<span class="notes">F             C           G           C</span>
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal

<span class="notes">                        Fmaj7                 C</span>
(Chorus) Lay down your burdens, lay down your shame
<span class="notes">            Fmaj7                 G</span>
All who are broken, lift up your face
<span class="notes">Gsus  G       Fmaj7                     Am</span>
Oh wanderer, come home, You're not too far
<span class="notes">                F                     G</span>
So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart
<span class="notes">            Fmaj7   G   Fmaj7</span>
Come as you are

There's hope for the hopeless and all those who've strayed
Come sit at the table, come taste the grace
There's rest for the weary, rest that endures
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't cure

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">Am    G/B</span>
Come as you are
<span class="notes">C     F</span>
Come as you are
<span class="notes">      C</span>
Fall in His arms
<span class="notes">      G</span>
Come as you are

There's joy for the morning, oh sinner, be still
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
