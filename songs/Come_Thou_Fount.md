#Come Thou Fount#

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
<span class="notes">	C	D	G</span>
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
<span class="notes">	G		D</span>
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
<span class="notes">	C	D	G</span>
Call for songs of loudest praise.
<span class="notes">	Em		G</span>
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
<span class="notes">	C	D	G</span>
Sung by flaming tongues above.
<span class="notes">	G		D</span>
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it,
<span class="notes">	C	D	G</span>
Mount of Thy unchanging love.

Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Here there by Thy great help I've come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above. 


O that day when freed from sinning,
I shall see Thy lovely face; Clothed then in blood-washed linen
How I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,
Take my ransomed soul away; 
Send Thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day.
