<span class="notes">G	D		Am</span>
I've got bills to pay, taxman on my tail
<span class="notes">G	D		Am</span>
Just keep praying that the check’s in the mail
<span class="notes">G	D			Am	C</span>
There are times it seems that everything's lost
<span class="notes">Am	C			D</span>
and I’m moaning, I'm tossed, and I see…

(Chorus) Between the river and the ravens I'm fed
Between oblivion and the blazes I'm led
So father give me faith, providence and grace
Between the river and ravens I'm fed
Sweet deliver, oh You lift up my head
And lead me in your way

I've grown sick and tired of trying to stand still
I've learned to let the wind pull me where it will
Throw myself into the will of the wait
I can never be great 'til we're free

(To Chorus)

Although I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death
Evil’s all around, coming from the right and the left
Trust that I will see the glory above
Oh, Your banner of love flies over me

(To Chorus x2)
