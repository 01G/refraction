#Death In His Grave#

Though the earth cried out for blood, satisfied her hunger was
Billows calmed on raging seas for the souls of men she craved
Sun and moon on balcony turned their head in disbelief
Their precious love would taste the sting disfigured and disdained

<span class="notes">	C	G	F	C</span>
(Chorus) On Friday a thief, on Sunday a king
<span class="notes">	C	G	F	C</span>
Laid down in grief but woke with the keys
<span class="notes">	Am	G	F	C</span>
To hell on that day first born of the slain
<span class="notes">	Am	G	F	C</span>
The man Jesus Christ laid death in his grave

So three days in darkness slept the morning sun of righteousness
But rose to shame the throws of death and overturn his rule 
Now daughters and the sons of men would not pay their dues again
The debt of blood they owed was rent when the day rolled anew

(To Chorus) 

<span class="notes">F		Am		G		F</span>
He has cheated hell and seated us above the fall
In desperate places he paid our wages one time once and for all

(To Chorus)
