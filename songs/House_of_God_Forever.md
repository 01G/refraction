God is my shepherd
I won't be wanting, I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
in fields of green with quiet streams
Even though I walk
through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
'cause You are with me, You are with me

<span class="notes">G		F		G</span>
Your shepherd staff comforts me
<span class="notes">		F		G</span>
You are my feast in the presence of enemy
<span class="notes">		F		Am</span>
Surely goodness will follow me,
<span class="notes">		F		C</span>
Will follow me in the house of God, forever.

(Repeat Song)
