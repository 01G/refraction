How deep the Father’s love for us,
<span class="notes">	D		A</span>
How vast beyond all measure,
<span class="notes">	D		G</span>
That He should give His only Son
<span class="notes">	D		A	D</span>
To make a wretch His treasure.
<span class="notes">	D		Bm</span>
How great the pain of searing loss -
<span class="notes">	D		A</span>
The Father turns His face away,
<span class="notes">	D		G</span>
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
<span class="notes">	D		A	D</span>
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life -
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer;
But this I know with all my heart -
His wounds have paid my ransom.
