He is jealous for me, love’s like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
When all of a sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are, and how great Your affections are for me.

Oh, how He loves us so, oh,
How He loves us, how He loves us so.

(Repeat All Above x1)

(Chorus) He loves us, oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves us, oh how He loves.

So we are his portion and he is our prize, drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,
If grace is an ocean we're all sinking.
So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss, and my heart turns violently inside of my chest.
I don't have time to maintain these regrets when I think about the way…

(To Chorus)

Well, I thought about You the day Steven died, and You met me between my breaking.
I know that I still love You, God, despite the agony.

They want to tell me You're cruel,   [Jon Wept]
But if Stephen could sing, he'd say it's not true, cause . . .
