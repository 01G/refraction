#It Is Well with My Soul#

When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
<span class="notes">	Bm	Em	A</span>
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
<span class="notes">	D	G		Em	A</span>
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
<span class="notes">	D/F	G	A	D</span>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

<span class="notes">		D	Bm7</span>
(Refrain) It is well, it is well,
<span class="notes">	F#m7		D</span>
With my soul, with my soul,
<span class="notes">	G	Em	A	D</span>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.
