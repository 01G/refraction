<span class="notes">E</span>
I will sing a song to you
<span class="notes">A</span>
And you will shake the ground for me
<span class="notes">E</span>
And the birds and bees and old fruit trees
<span class="notes">A</span>
Will spit out songs like gushing streams
And Jesus will come through the ground so dirty
With worms in his hair and a hand so sturdy
To call us his magic we call him worthy
Jesus came up through the ground so dirty

I will sing a song for to you
And you will stomp your feet for me
And the bears and bees and banana trees
Will play kazoos and tambourines
And Jesus will dance while we drink his wine
With soldiers and thieves and a sword in his side
And we will be joy and we will be right
Jesus will dance while we drink his wine

La La La La Laaa, La La La La
La La La La Laaa, La La La La

Jesus will come through the ground so dirty
With worms in his hair and a hand so sturdy
To call us his magic we call him worthy
Jesus came up through the ground so dirty

Jesus came up through the ground so dirty (Repeat x4)
