#Jesus Paid It All#
##Elvina Hall, 1865##
<pre>
<span class="notes">G</span>
I hear the Savior say, 
<span class="notes">	D		G</span>
Thy strength indeed is small;
<span class="notes">	Em7			C</span>
Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
<span class="notes">	G	D	G</span>
Find in Me thine all in all.

<span class="notes">	G		Em7</span>
(Refrain) Jesus paid it all,
<span class="notes">G		D</span>
All to Him I owe;
<span class="notes">G		C</span>
Sin had left a crimson stain, 
<span class="notes">	G	D	G</span>
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find 
Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots 
and melt the heart of stone.

(To Refrain) 

And when before the throne 
I stand in Him complete,
Jesus died my soul to save,
my lips shall still repeat

(To Refrain)

O Praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
(Repeat x4)

(To Refrain)
</pre>
