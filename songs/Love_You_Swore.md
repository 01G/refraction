<span class="notes">G			C</span>
Chase me down like a lion, like a bird of prey
<span class="notes">G				C</span>
Lift me up from the ashes of my heart’s own shallow grave
<span class="notes">Em			D/F#</span>
I know that I love You, but sometimes I'm afraid

<span class="notes">G</span>
(Chorus) Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
<span class="notes">C</span>
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
<span class="notes">G</span>
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
<span class="notes">C</span>
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Spare my body from the wolves, God, that crouch down at my door
Lift me up above the waters and the sharks that guard Your shores
I know that I need You, just sometimes I know it more

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">C                                  			G                     D/F#</span>
Harbor me in the eye of the storm, I'm holding on to the love You swore
<span class="notes">C                                  			G                     D/F#</span>
Harbor me in the eye of the storm, I'm holding on to the love You swore
<span class="notes">Em                               			  D/F#                                	C</span>
Harbor me in the eye of the storm, Yeah! I’m holding on to the love You swore

(To Chorus)
				         (Together)
<span class="notes">G</span>
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
<span class="notes">C</span>
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Harbor me in the eye of the storm

I'm holding on to the love You swore

(Repeat x3)
