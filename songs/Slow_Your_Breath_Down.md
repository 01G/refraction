This chest is full of memories - of gold and silver tears.
<span class="notes">	Am					C		G</span>
I'll give you more to own than all of this - Iâ€™ll give you more than years.
<span class="notes">	C			F</span>
For you were once a child of innocence and I see you just the same.
<span class="notes">	Am					C		G</span>
Your burdens couldn't win or lose a thing. Oh, I'd tell you once again, 
<span class="notes">			C</span>
but you're always on the run.

<span class="notes">	C					Cma7</span>
(Chorus) Slow your breathe down just take it slow. Find your heart now, oh. 
<span class="notes">F                          	C        G</span>
You can trust and love again. Oh oh ohhh
Slow your breathe down just take it slow. Find your smile now, oh.
You can trust and love again. Oh oh ohhh

If you leave I'll still be close to you when all your fears rain down. 
I'll take you back a thousand times again. And I'll take you as my own.
I would sing your songs of innocence. 'Til the light of morning comes.
'Til the rays of gold and honey cover you. In the sweetness of the dawn,
But you're always on the run.

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">C		Cma7</span>
You're not alone. You're now a part of me. 
<span class="notes">F		G</span>
You feel the cure. I'll feel the toil it brought you.
(Repeat)

(To Chorus)
