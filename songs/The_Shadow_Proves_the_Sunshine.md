Sunshine, won't you be my mother,
<span class="notes">A	B		C#m	B</span>
Sunshine, come and help me sing
My heart is darker than these oceans,
My heart is frozen underneath.

<span class="notes">		E			B		C#m		B</span>
(Chorus) We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight, dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
<span class="notes">A			B		A		B</span>
The shadow proves the sunshine, the shadow proves the sunshine
Too scared that I'll run away, hold fast till the break of day, well
The shadow proves the sunshine, the shadow proves the sunshine

Oh Lord, why did you forsake me?
Oh Lord, don't be far away
Storm Clouds gathering beside me
Please Lord, don't look the other way

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">E	A	C#m	A	E	A	C#m	A</span>
Yeah, yeah, Shine on me!	Yeah, yeah, Shine on me!
<span class="notes">E	F#m	C#m	A	E	F#m	C#m	A</span>
Yeah, yeah, Shine on me!	Shine on me!

(To Chorus)

Yeah, yeah, Shine on me! 	Yeah, yeah, Shine on me!
Yeah, yeah, Shine on me! 	Shine on me!
Let my shadows prove the sunshine
