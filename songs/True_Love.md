Come close, listen to the story
<span class="notes">D				Bm	A	G</span>
About a love more faithful than the morning
<span class="notes">D/F#		G	Bm		A</span>
The Father gave His only Son just to save us

<span class="notes">		D			D/F#</span>
(Chorus) The earth was shaking in the dark
<span class="notes">Bm				A	G</span>
All creation felt the Father's broken heart
<span class="notes">		D			D/F#</span>
Tears were filling heaven's eyes
<span class="notes">	Bm				A	G</span>
The day that true love died, the day that true love died
When blood and water hit the ground
Walls we couldn't move came crashing down
We were free and made alive
The day that true love died, the day that true love died

Search your hearts, you know you can't deny it
Lose your life just so you can find it
The Father gave His only Son just to save us

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">G		G</span>
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive
<span class="notes">Bm		A</span>
Jesus is alive, Jesus is alive
<span class="notes">Em		D/F#</span>
Jesus is alive, Yeah he is alive
<span class="notes">Asus		A</span>
He rose again

(To Chorus)
