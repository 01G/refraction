Have mercy on me, O God
According to Your unfailing love
According to Your great compassion
Blot out my transgressions
(Repeat)

(Refrain) Would you create in me a clean heart, O God?
Restore in me the joy of Your salvation
Would you create in me a clean heart, O God?
Restore in me the joy of Your salvation

The sacrifices of our God are a broken and a contrite heart
Against You and You alone have I sinned
The sacrifices of our God are a broken and a contrite heart
Against You and You alone have I sinned

(To Refrain)

(Chorus) Wash me white as snow and I will be made whole
Wash me white as snow, and I will be made whole
Wash me white as snow, and I will be made whole
Wash me white as snowâ€¦

(To Refrain)
