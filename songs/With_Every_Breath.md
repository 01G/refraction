Allellua from the heavens, Allellua in the heights above the earth
Allellua all His angels, Allellua for the last will be first

<span class="notes">		A		B		C#</span>
(Refrain) Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
<span class="notes">	A		B		C#</span>
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord

Allellua in the morning, Allellua for the beauty of His scars
Allellua in the twilight, Allellua sun and moon and shining stars

(To Refrain)

<span class="notes">			A		E		B</span>
(Chorus) When the night seems so long (throw your hands to the sky)
<span class="notes">	A		E		B</span>
You can sing a new song (wipe the tears from your eyes)
<span class="notes">		A		E		B</span>
When you're weak, He is strong
<span class="notes">	B	A			B	E</span>
He can heal your wounded soul and calm the storm inside


For all your times of laughter, in every hopeful prayer
When the world weighs on your shoulders, through sorrow and your despair
<span class="notes">		A		B		C#</span>
With everything, with every breath, praise the Lord

(To Refrain x3)

(To Chorus)
