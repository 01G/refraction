<span class="notes">Am	F	C	G</span>

There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me, It's You. It’s You.

Sometimes ignorance rings true
Hope is not in what I know
It's not in me, It’s in You. It’s in You.

<span class="notes">	Am          F</span>
(Refrain) It’s all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know

I find peace when i'm confused
I find hope when I'm let down
Not in me, in You. It’s in You

I hope to lose myself for good
I hope to find it in the end
Not in me, in You. In You.

(To Refrain)

<span class="notes">C	F</span>
In you (x4)

There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me, It's You. It’s You.
