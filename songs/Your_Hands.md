<span class="notes">C	G	C</span>
I have unanswered prayers
<span class="notes">	G		F	C</span>
I have trouble I wish wasn't there
<span class="notes">	C		F	Am</span>
And I have asked a thousand ways
<span class="notes">	G		F	C</span>
That You would take my pain away
<span class="notes">	G		F	C</span>
That You would take my pain away

I am trying to understand
How to walk this weary land
Make straight the paths that crookedly lie
Oh Lord, before these feet of mine
Oh Lord, before these feet of mine

<span class="notes">		Am	G	C    F	C	G</span>
(Chorus) When my world is shaking, Heaven stands
<span class="notes">Am	    G	    C		F    G		C</span>
When my heart is breaking, I never leave Your hands

When You walked upon the Earth
You healed the broken, lost, and hurt
I know You hate to see me cry
One day You will set all things right
Yeah, one day You will set all things right

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">	G</span>
Your hands
<span class="notes">	F     C	 Am    C   G</span>
Your hands that shape the world
<span class="notes">	F	E7</span>
Are holding me, they hold me still
<span class="notes">	F     C	 Am    C   G</span>
Your hands that shape the world
<span class="notes">	F	E7</span>
Are holding me, they hold me still

(To Chorus)
<span class="notes">F    C	G</span>
I never leave... 
<span class="notes">F	G	     C</span>
I never leave Your hands
