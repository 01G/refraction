Heavenly Father, You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come in my world and in my life
You give me the food I need to live through the day
Forgive me as I forgive the people that wronged me

<span class="notes">G#m		B5/E</span>
Lead me far from temptation,
<span class="notes">G#m7	B5/E	Bsus4	B5/E	G#m7	B5/E</span>
and deliver me from the evil one

I look out the window, the birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune or out of place
I walk to the meadow and stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl on her wedding day

<span class="notes">G#m7		B5/E	G#m7		B5/E</span>
So why should I worry? Why do I freak out?
<span class="notes">	       Bsus4	B5/E	       F#</span>
God knows what I need, You know what I need

<span class="notes">	C#m7	            B/D#	      E5		F#5</span>
(Chorus) Your love is,  Your love is,  Your love is strong (Repeat x3)

The kingdom of the heavens is now advancing
Invade my heart, invade this broken town
The kingdom of the heavens is buried treasure
Would you sell yourself to buy the One you found?

Two things You told me - that You are strong
And You love me, Yes, You love me

(To Chorus)

<span class="notes">C#m7		B/D#	         E5</span>
Our God in heaven hallowed be
<span class="notes">	      F#5</span>
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come, Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Keep us far from our vices and
Deliver us from these prisons
